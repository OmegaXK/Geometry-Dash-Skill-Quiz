Now, add up all your points, and see which rank YOU fit in!

0-10 points: Beginner! Welcome to Geometry Dash! Just because you scored low doesn't mean you're not good, it means you're just getting started! Work hard and you should be able to achieve great things!



11- 50 points: Novice! You're not quite new to the game, but you're still getting used to the game and it's mechanics. You've most likely collected a small amount of Secret Coins and beaten a good few of the official levels. You're not the best, but DEFINITELY not the worst! You should also be getting your first few User Coins around now!



51-100 points: Average! By this point you've most likely beaten around half of the official levels, and have a nice amount of Secret Coins, and you're starting to get a few more User Coins. You may even have one or two easy demons under your belt. Keep it up!



101-175 points: Experienced! Wow, great job on scoring this high! This means you're better than the average player! This also means you've beaten almost every official level except for maybe a few Insane levels and the 3 demons. By now your secret coin pile is getting rather big, and you've collected a fair share of User Coins, too! You also probably have a few demons such as the Nightmare and The Lightning Road done, too.



176-350 points: Expert! Now you're really getting up there! Your Secret Coin pile is getting really large now, and so is your User Coin pile! Official levels are no longer a problem, and at least one of the 3 official demons should be done!  You're now moving on to demons, and lots of them. Clubstep, Theory Of Everything 2, and Deadlocked were just the first steps to beating some of the big ones... Have you got what it takes?



351-543 points: Professional! You've reached the point where few things can stand in your way. The official levels are long behind you, your User Coin pile is growing nonstop, and you've gotten almost every possible Secret Coin. You've gotten several good demons under your belt- maybe even a few insane ones. But titans like Cataclysm and Bloodbath still loom over, far, far out of reach. It's gonna take a true master to even try to bring them down...



544-1550 points: Master! It's been a long road, but you have finally reached the absolute. No secret coins remain, and User Coins are becoming very scarce. Your star count is beginning to get in the very, very high hundreds, if not easily thousands. Regular demon levels are no longer a challenge. Only the true hardest levels remain... Cataclysm. Bloodbath. Acropolis. Supersonic. Windy Landscape (The new version, the old one is easy as crap). Ultrasonic. Conical Depression. Maybe, just maybe, you can bring down one of these titans. Your name may go down in Geometry Dash history... 



1551+ points: EXTREMELY Addicted! You're addicted. Time to stop before your finger falls off. Seriously. Stop.
